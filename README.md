# Personal Project - Creation Basin

Creation Basin is a site where users can display, sell, and blog about their creative works. They can search for games, books, posters or other users. They have there own profiles which others can view and follow. Users can add new posters to their collection, which can immediately be searched for after being added. 

The site is also fully responsive.

There would be one SQL table for all the products, if I did not use third party APIs for game and book searches.
